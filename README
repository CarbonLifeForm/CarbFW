1. Purpose
   This script was started to generate ip6tables rules for hosts and the current
   release more or less supports this. However there is a section that controls 
   routing and this is mainly for the purpose of handling minor forwarding 
   filtering with regards to virtual machines and filtering the routes between 
   their private networks.

2. Configuration & Defaults
   Currently the script uses variables at the beginning of the script to control
   it's behavior. Editing of these variables changes sections of the resulting
   rules. 

   2.1 Control variables
   These variables enable and disable different code blocks. They can be set as
   on with the value of "1", any other value disables them. 
    * flush - enables a code block to remove the current iptables rules and
    tables.
    * mobile - enables rules to allow the transit of Mobile IPv6 related ICMP
    packets
    * backup - enables code to backup your current ip6tables rules, restorable
    with ip6tables-restore <filename>
    * r_enable - enables the iptables that go into the FORWARD table
    * r_stateful - enables a rule to statefully allow returning packets

   2.2 Host variables
   These variables influence and provide data and settings for various parts of
   the host oriented ip6tables rule generation. These sections describe what 
   format the script will expect in the variable.
    * backup_file - variable sets the location of the ip6tables-save output
    * ip6t - the variable that stores the ip6tables location/flags/command
    * localPrefix - An array that stores all the network prefixes you would
    consider to be local and implicitly trusted 
    * internetPrefix - an array storing public prefixes so that packets sourced
    from these IPs can be considered local as well
    * localPorts - ports to accept from hosts in the networks specified in the
    previous two variables. The ports are specified in the /etc/services
    standard of <port number>/<transport protocol> and seperated by spaces.
    * publicPorts - ports to accept from the big wide internets. 

   2.3 Routing variables
   These variables control various behaviors within the routing rules generation
   subsystem. 
   * r_blockPorts - specifies ports to block while crossing the FORWARD table
   using the /etc/services format specified in earlier configuration parameters
   * r_interf - specifies directional allowed transit paths between interfaces
   while crossing the FORWARD table. Combinations are specified by a custom
   standard of [source interface]>[destination interface] and seperated by
   spaces. If r_stateful is enabled packets can return to their source network
   without an explicitly specified return path in this section.

3. Development
   Please bear in mind this is an early development release. If you find any
   bugs, have any ideas, or have coded any features, please send them back to
   the maintainer. This script may also see major changes in the future;
   backwards compatability is likely to be a rare luxury. 
   The current maintainer of this script is CarbonLifeForm<at>psych0tik.net
